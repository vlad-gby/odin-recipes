  <p>This recipe is a pretty basic version, but everyone who makes baked ziti has their own unique tricks and twists to
    it. Some vary the cheeses, some the meat, some make meatless versions, and some people leave out the tomato sauce
    for a truly cheese-tastic casserole.</p>

  <p>This version uses bulk Italian sausage, as well as a key fresh herb. In summer, that would be basil. In winter,
    rosemary. You could also easily use savory, sage, thyme, or parsley.</p>

  <!-- METHOD -->

  <h2>Method step-by-step</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Preheat the oven to 350°F</b></li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Cook the pasta: </b>
      <p>Heat a large pot of salted water (for every 2 quarts of water, one tablespoon of salt) to a strong boil. Add
        the pasta and cook at a rolling boil, uncovered, until the pasta is al dente—edible but still a little firm to
        the bite.</p>
      <p>Drain the pasta through a colander. Toss with a little olive oil so the pasta does not stick together while you
        make the sauce.</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Brown the meat: </b>
      <p>While the water is heating in the previous step, start on the sauce. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large
        sauté pan on medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering hot, add the bulk sausage or ground meat. Break up any
        large chunks of sausage as it cooks. Brown well.</p>
      <p>Don't stir that often or it will be more difficult for the meat to brown. If you are using ground beef or pork
        instead of sausage, sprinkle with a little salt.</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Make the sauce: </b>
      <p>When the meat is mostly browned, add the onions and stir well to combine. Sauté everything until the onions are
        translucent and beginning to brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>Add the garlic, rosemary or basil, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. Cook 1 minute,
        then add the tomato sauce and stir well. Bring to a simmer.</p>
      <p>Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper, if needed.</p>

    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Assemble the casserole:</b>
      <p>Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole pan, then dot the surface with half the ricotta cheese. Ladle a spoonful of sauce into the pasta, stir it well and then add the pasta into the casserole.</p>
      <p>Pour the rest of the sauce over the pasta, dot the remaining ricotta cheese over the pasta, and sprinkle on top both the mozzarella and the Parmesan cheese.</p>
